# FarChurch Farcaster Frame

## About

FarChurch is a project inspired by my housemate who is a faithful christian. She
recently started a 5-day quest on Threads (Twitter alternative by Facebook) to
share daily thanksgiving reflections. I thought it would be a good idea to
create a frame and fracaster bot whenever someone starts a new quest the frame
and bot will keep track of the quest and share the daily reflections to the
/farchurch community channel.

A NFT bedge will be minted on the completion of the quest and the user will be
able to claim the badge as a token of completion. This will be a fun way to
encourage people to share their daily thanksgiving reflection and also to keep
track of their progress.
